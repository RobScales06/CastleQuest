Attack Name: Scrub

Generally concerned with keeping things clean and in order,
Null Monsters typically stand by during battles and 
fill in for other monsters if something goes wrong.
Wielding a brush to clean up after a battle is over,
a Null Monster is trained to look for irregularities and
sort them out, occasionally including the rugged protagonist.
